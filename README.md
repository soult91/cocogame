# Cocogame - A videogame as therapy for Dysexecutive syndrome

It consists of a video game and an application for using it as a therapy for Dysexecutive Syndrome in which users have to perform daily activities to train their capacities, and at the same time the specialist can see the improve in their patients trough the application.
 
> **VIDEOGAME**

Videogame has been developed in Unity, with .NET as backend and matlab (data base on the cloud of Mongo) as DB. The backend contain almost every function for a basic APIRest. In first time you have to register if the specialist didn't do it, because it can do it through the web application too, then patient can start to play. When the game is over, the web app receive the score of patient and show results in graphs.

> **WEB APP**

The application for the specialist has been developed in  <img height="30" src="https://github.com/hussainweb/hussainweb/blob/main/icons/angular.png">Angular9 (FrontEnd) and  <img height="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dereknguyen269/dereknguyen269/master/images/nodejs.png">NodeJS (Backend), it contains methods to see the evolution of patients during therapy. It uses graph libraries to show data.

Patients can play two types of games, in the first one user has to perform daily tasks such as take a toothbrush and then the toothcream, etc. In the second one the patients has to perform another daily activity like dressing, so they start putting on their underwear and then the trousers...etc.

> **DATABASE**

The database of this system is mlab (a fully managed cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases).

It was very hard develop the backend of videogame due to the lack of documentation of Unity and Mongo, so I think is a good idea to share this project.
